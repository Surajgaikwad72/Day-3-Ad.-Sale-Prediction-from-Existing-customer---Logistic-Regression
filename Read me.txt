Machine Learning Challenge - December 2024
This repository contains my journey and work on the Machine Learning challenge I took in December 2024. The challenge focuses on applying and experimenting with various machine learning algorithms to build meaningful projects and gain a deeper understanding of their functionalities and applications.

Objective
The goal of this challenge was to explore and implement various machine learning algorithms, including both supervised and unsupervised learning models, and apply them to real-world datasets. The challenge covers a wide range of techniques, from basic regression to more complex ensemble methods.

Algorithms Covered
Supervised Learning:
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
Naive Bayes
Gradient Boosting
Unsupervised Learning:
k-Means Clustering
Hierarchical Clustering
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Reinforcement Learning:
Q-Learning
Deep Q Networks (DQN)
Projects and Implementations
Each algorithm was applied to various real-world datasets for different machine learning tasks such as:

Classification (e.g., predicting customer churn)
Regression (e.g., predicting house prices)
Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation)
Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., reducing features for better visualization)
